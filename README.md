## Installation and Usage
## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - **Prerequisites:** Python 3.6+, OpenAI API Key ([https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
  
 Obtain an OpenAI API key and save it in a file called `api_key.json` in the following format:
```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
```
Note this first step can be skipped as when the main.py is loaded for the first time it will ask you for an API key

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install pyqt5 pyphen python-docx beautifulsoup4 openai
```
3. Clone this repository and navigate into it.
4. Run the application using the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
5. Type text into the main editor window.
6. Highlight text and right click to access assistant features.

Use the toolbar and menu bar options for additional features. Chat with the docked AI assistant widget for help.

## Customizing

The AI assistant capabilities can be customized by modifying the `openai_chat` and `openai_chat2` functions.

Web searching can be configured by adding API keys and modifying the `internet_search` functions.
